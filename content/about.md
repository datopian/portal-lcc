# Welcome to Lincolnshire Open Data!

Lincolnshire Open Data has been created to support Lincolnshire County Council's commitment to freeing up Lincolnshire's data. It’s a place for the public, researchers, and developers to access and analyse information about the county. We want citizens to be able to use the data that is held within this site — free of charge — in innovative ways.

Lincolnshire Open Data is the place where Lincolnshire County Council's internal data will be readily accessible. The council's datasets will be added to by a number of datasets owned by other organisations and thought to provide valuable data about Lincolnshire.

This site contains a catalogue of data. You can search for, preview, and download a wide range of data in a number of different themes (see the [Topics](/topics) link at the top).  
A list of all datasets on the site is shown in the [Open Datasets Register](/@resources/open-datasets-register).
